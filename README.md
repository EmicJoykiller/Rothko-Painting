The HTML structure consists of a <div> element with the class .canvas, which serves as the main canvas for the painting. Inside this canvas, there are three <div> elements with classes .one, .two, and .three, each representing different colored sections of the painting.

Canvas Styling:
The .canvas class defines the dimensions (500px width and 600px height) and background color (#4d0f00) of the canvas.
The overflow: hidden; property ensures that any content overflowing the canvas is hidden.
A subtle blur effect (filter: blur(2px);) is applied to the canvas, giving it a softer appearance.
Frame Styling:
The .frame class represents the frame surrounding the canvas. It has a black border (50px), padding (50px), and margin (20px auto) for centering.
Color Blocks:
.one and .two classes represent two colored blocks within the canvas, each styled with specific dimensions, background colors (#efb762 and #8f0401), margins, box shadows, border radius, and slight blur effects (filter: blur(1px);).
.three class defines another colored block with a different background color (#b20403), unique border-radius values, a more prominent blur effect (filter: blur(2px);), and a box shadow.
The combination of these elements and their styling creates a composition reminiscent of Mark Rothko's abstract paintings, showcasing color blending, geometric shapes, and subtle visual effects.
